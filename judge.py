        You are evaluating a financial QA system's prediction.

        Please assign a score based on the following criteria:

        - Score 1.0: The predicted answer is numerically correct (±5% of the expected value), and the reasoning is sound.
        - Score 0.5: The reasoning shows correct logic or formula use, but the final numerical answer is incorrect.
        - Score 0.0: The answer and reasoning are both incorrect, missing, or irrelevant.

        {{
          "score": <float: 0.0, 0.5, or 1.0>,
